## Purpose

This fourth project of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (FEND) instructed me to build a test suite for an RSS feed reader program. In this project, I learned the Jasmine testing framework, and developed Jasmine tests both to check that an existing program functions properly, and to enable me to make edits to the program without breaking it.

## How_to_Run

Option 1: Visit http://feed-reader-testing.volantweb.com/ for a live, functioning version of the program and test. (And then visit volantweb.com to see more of my recent clients!)

Option 2: Run the game locally on your computer (requires Internet connection, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
* Download the repository from GitHub
* Note that program requries Jasmine, a JavaScript library fount within /jasmine/lib/jasmine-2.1.2 (no special installation required)
* Open the downloaded folder
* Double-click on the 'index.html' file, or drag it into your web browser of choice
* Feed will load in the top section; Jasmine results will load beneath that

## Learning

I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of test-driven programming, and the Jasmine framework. I can see many applications already, in terms of improving the build process for new programs, and for getting familiar with existing complex programs. 

I found it particularly interesting to learn how to access specific elements of the DOM that were not loaded at the time of coding. Using the `entryElement[0].innerHTML` principle was very enlightening.
